# Color_Circles

The user can draw colored circles. The app has three modes of operation: drawing, deleting and moving. It can only be in one mode at a time

In the drawing mode the circles are not moving. When the user places one finger on the screen a circle is drawn on the screen. The center of the circle is where the user touched the screen. The user moves their finger to increase the radius of the circle. As the user moves their finger farther from the center of the circle, the circle gets larger. When the user lifts their finger the size of the circle is fixed. App supports multiple circles. While in drawing mode the user can select via a menu which color the circle should be when
drawn. The user can select the colors blue, red, green and black. The default color it is black.

The user can delete circles in the delete mode. When the user touches inside a circle the circle is removed. If the spot where the user touches the screen is inside multiple circles at the same time they are all deleted.

With the moving mode, the user can put the circles in motion. The user sets a circle in motion by placing a finger in a circle and swiping in any direction. The circles will start moving in direction and velocity indicated by the swipe. Different circles can be moving in different directions with different speeds.
